# Antiforget-Inator 2000

## About
The Antiforget-Inator 2000 was designed to provide a streamlined, easy-to-use interface for patients with Dementia and Alzheimer's. It allows users to speak into the interface to plan, schedule, and remember activities, as well as showing them all pending tasks.

Using a simple command line interface, it is simple with no visually distracting elements providing the most ergonomic and convenient experience ever.

## Voice Commands
- Today (implemented successfully)): Shows all events the user has for the day. It organizes it in chronological order and shows a summary of the event if needed.
- Tomorrow: Shows all events the user has for the next day. It organizes it in chronological order and shows a summary of the event if needed.
- Add Event (implemented successfully): Allows the user to create a new event. There are specialized templates to help the user create certain types of events. For example, there may be medication events, birthday events, or even appointment reminders! Furthermore, users can add notes and useful links related to the event to keep everything together.
- Medication (implemented successfuly): The user can set up reminders to take their medication on time. They can also add notes such as medicine type and dosage.
- Edit Event: Allows the user to make changes to existing events.
- Delete Event: In case of cancellations, the user can delete the event.

- Reminders will be sent to the user before the event happens.
- Users can tick the event off of their list after it is done. This ensures that events are only deleted after they happen and so the user can remember it even if they missed it.
